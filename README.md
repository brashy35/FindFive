# Find Five 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **Find Five**, a browser game I made where you stare at a chaotic image and try to click on five targets that are represented by different emojis.

Built with Phaser + Vite

## The Game

You get a cluttered scene full of distractions. Your goal: 
**Click on all 5 targets** before you run out of lives. If you select incorrectly too many times it’s game over.

Includes modals for:
- Win / Lose screens
- Game instructions
- Sharing your results with friends

## How to Run locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local server it tells you about — usually http://localhost:5173

you'll need Node.js installed to do this

## Why I Made This

I love the Where's Waldo type puzzles and thought, “why not make my own modern-take with emojis?”

---

## Maybe coming soon:

- New levels each day at midnight
- Touch controls for mobile
- Timer-based scoring / streaks

Let’s see how fast you can Find Five
